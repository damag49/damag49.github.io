        Buying a gemstone can be an exhilarating experience given their mystical nature combined with extraordinary
        beauty and diverse colours.
        While the Internet gives one a plethora of options when it comes to buying gemstones or reading about them, not
        all sources can be relied upon or are informative enough.
        Whether you're buying a gemstone for astrological purpose or to be used as a jewellery, we can help you find
        exactly what you're looking for. This step by step guide will help you select the right gemstone that fits your
        budget with ease.

    <h1 class="guide-header"><small>How to select the Gemstone?</small></h1>
    <div class="guide1">
      <p1 style="font-size:120%">
        Since ancient times, gemstones have been worn for astrological and jewelry purposes. The selection of a jewelry
        gemstone depends largely on its aesthetic value and durability, however, the criteria for selecting an
        astrological gemstone is more complex. It involves astrological calculations and requires an in-depth analysis
        of the individual’s horoscope (Kundli) by a learned astrologer. Since gemstones used for astrological purposes
        can have an effect on the career, finance, profession and personal life , we recommend consulting an expert
        astrologer prior to purchasing one.

    <div class="guide1">
      <p1 style="font-size:120%">
        Gemstones are not just worn as fashionable jewel stone but also for their astrological value and healing
        properties. It is very important to be assured of the quality and authenticity of the gemstone to avoid
        unpleasant surprises. Many fraudulent gem dealers use different tricks to sell fake gems as real. As a buyer,
        you have to be aware of the common tricks employed by fraud dealers to sell spurious gemstones to their
        customers.

        It is always advisable to buy gemstone from a reputed seller who is happy to answer your question honestly.
        Investing in a genuine, lab certified gemstone and hallmarked jewelry is a good way to ensure the best value for
        money. When purchasing a rare and expensive gemstone from a popular origin, one should be extra careful and must
        rely only on the certificates issued by the prestigious gem labs like IGI, GTL, GIA, GRS etc..

      <p1 style="font-size:120%">
        Once you have been prescribed to wear a gemstone, the question arises – What is the right way to wear this
        gemstone?

        Gemstones can be best worn in the form of a jewellery. The selection of a metal and jewelry setting that
        compliment the gem’s physical and astrological properties is a crucial step to ensure maximum positive results
        and maintain gem’s quality for a longer time. Some vedic norms are also involved in the selection of a right
        metal and jewelry design for an astrological gemstone .

        As per the scared vedas, each planet has been assigned a particular metal in which its gemstone gives fruitful
        results. Another important aspect is to ensure that the gemstone is touching the wearer’s skin properly after
        being studded in a jewelry piece. Those who believe in Pooja rituals, must follow the right vedic procedure to
        wear a gemstone (Ratna Dharan Karne Ki Vidhi ) to attain maximum benefits in their life.

    <h1 class="guide-header"><small>Where should i purchase from?</small></h1>
    <div class="guide1">
      <p1 style="font-size:120%">
        There are multiple considerations that one needs to factor in before purchasing a gemstone. Being aware of these
        factors that affect gemstone quality and price help in avoiding the chances of buying unauthentic gemstones at
        unfair prices. Before selecting a gemstone, it is imperative to know how a minor variation in quality, size or
        origin can bring a huge difference in the gemstone price.

        Color, clarity, cut and carat weight are some conventional factors considered while purchasing a gemstone.
        However, from the astrological point of view, it is equally important to ensure that the gemstone is 100%
        natural and free from any sort of treatment (heating, chemical treatment, dying and resin filling etc.).
        According to the experts, selecting a gemstone from a reputed geographical origin can be a good way to ensure
        quality. But it is not mandatory if one can manage to find good quality gemstones even from a less popular
        origin. All the gemstones present in GemPundit’s inventory are carefully examined by our expert gemologist. So,
        from our side, we can assure you of the quality and authenticity of the gemstones available on our website.
